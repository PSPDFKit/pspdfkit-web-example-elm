# Nutrient Web SDK Example – Elm

This example shows how to integrate [Nutrient Web SDK](https://www.nutrient.io/sdk/web/) into an [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) app.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
- A Nutrient Web SDK license. If you don't already have one
  you can [request a free trial here](https://www.nutrient.io/try/).

## Support, Issues and License Questions

PSPDFKit offers support for customers with an active SDK license via https://www.nutrient.io/support/request/

Are you [evaluating our SDK](https://www.nutrient.io/try/)? That's great, we're happy to help out! To make sure this is fast, please use a work email and have someone from your company fill out our sales form: https://www.nutrient.io/sales/

## Getting Started

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PSPDFKit/pspdfkit-web-example-elm.git
cd pspdfkit-web-example-elm
```

Install the project dependencies with `npm`:

```bash
npm install
```

Now that everything is installed we need to configure the app to use our [Nutrient Web SDK license key](https://www.nutrient.io/guides/web/current/standalone/integration).

Edit `./config/license-key` and replace the string `YOUR_LICENSE_KEY_GOES_HERE` with the license key that you received via e-mail.

## Running the Example

We are ready to launch the app! 🎉

```bash
npm run start
```

You can now open http://localhost:8080 in your browser and enjoy!
